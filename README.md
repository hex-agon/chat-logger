# Chat Logger
This plugin allows logging chat messages from different channels to individual files. Currently, the plugin supports public, group, game, private and clan channels and each can be toggled on/off individually.
The log file rotation happens on a daily basis and up to 30 log files are kept. However, this can be changed from the plugin's settings.

The logs can be found at RuneLite's home folder under the `chatlogs` directory. To find runelite's home navigate to `%userprofile%\.runelite` on Windows or `$HOME/.runelite` on Linux and macOS.

### Directory structure
The plugin uses the following directory structure:
```
.runelite/
└── chatlogs/
    ├── friends/
    ├── private/
    ├── public/
    ├── group/
    ├── game/
    └── clan/
```

Note that the **friends** folder contains the **clan chat** logs and the **private** folder contains **private messages** from friends.

### Remote Submission

This plugins allows you to configure submission of your clan chat messages to a remote endpoint. To enable it the user must configure an endpoint and tick the box on the plugin's configuration.

#### Submitted payload & behavior

#### Behavior

The plugin submits chat messages every 5 seconds, multiple chat entries can be submitted at once up to a max of 30 entries.
It also uses a circuit breaker to avoid making requests to a non-functional endpoint.
The circuit breaker opens if more than 3 requests fail within 30 seconds and will switch to half-open after 5 minutes.

**It is also worth nothing that multiple clients may submit the same message, deduplication should be done server side!**

#### Payload structure

The plugin uses the following structure to submit messages:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1417339442575,
    "timestamp": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000000000Z",
    "chatType": "FRIENDS",
    "chatName": "player name",
    "sender": "player name",
    "rank": -1,
    "message": "Dasdasd"
  }
]
```
